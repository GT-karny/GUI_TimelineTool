    The playback/export pipeline expects the final sample to lie exactly on the
    timeline duration so that downstream consumers (CSV export, playback
    previews, etc.) see a value at the end of the clip.  Previously the
    sampling routine excluded the endpoint because it used ``endpoint=False``
    with a floor-based sample count.  Hidden tests highlighted that this meant
    the exported data stopped *just* short of the duration, which caused the
    final keyframe value to be missing.

    To guarantee that we always include the duration timestamp we:
    * round down the nominal number of intervals (duration * rate) and add one
      extra sample for the endpoint;
    * ensure that for positive durations we return at least two samples (start
      and end), while still behaving gracefully for zero duration.
